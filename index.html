    <p>
      Turkish delight or lokum is a family of confections based on a gel of
      starch and sugar. Premium varieties consist largely of chopped dates,
      pistachios, hazelnuts or walnuts bound by the gel; traditional varieties
      are often flavored with rosewater, mastic gum, bergamot orange, or lemon.
      Other common flavors include cinnamon and mint. The confection is often
      packaged and eaten in small cubes dusted with icing sugar, copra, or
      powdered cream of tartar to prevent clinging. The origin of Turkish
      delight is not precisely known, but the confection is known to have been
      produced in Turkey and Iran (Persia) since the late 18th century.
