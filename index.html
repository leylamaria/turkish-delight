    <h1>ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡· Turkish Delight</h1>
    <p>
      Because Turkish delight has its origins in Turkey, itâ€™s unsurprising that
      it has a couple of other familiar names, including Lokum. Lokum is the
      Turkish name for Turkish delight. It has its origins in the Arabic word,
      al-lukum, which can be loosely translated to mean morsel or mouthful. You
      might also see Turkish delight referred to as Rahat-ul hulkÃ¼m, which means
      â€˜throat comfortâ€™. In most of the western world, youâ€™ll only see Turkish
      delight sold as, Turkish delight, but if you were buying from a Turkish
      shop, or restaurant then donâ€™t be surprised if it is labeled as Lokum.
